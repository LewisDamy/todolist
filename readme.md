### A Todo List overengineered

This is an Complex Todo List, that allows users to:
- SignUp
- SignIn
- Create hashed passwords
- Use in memory repository
  
Besides of course the roots of an TodoList:
- Create item, with priority
- Search it
- Make as complete
- Change description
- Change priority
- Create multiple lists of items

All of that has been done in order to get a deep understading of:
- Oriented Object Programming
- Test Driven Development (TDD) with help of PyTest
